            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Four Beans Coffee, where our passion for coffee blends with our love for creating a warm and inviting space for our community.</p>
            <p>It all began with a simple idea &shy; to create a coffee shop that would serve as a coworking space and as a hub for connection, creativity, and inspiration. Four Beans Coffee was founded by a group of four friends and coffee enthusiasts who met during a programming course. While coding for hours on end, they've discovered a shared passion for coffee.</p>
            <p>From the moment we opened our doors for the first time in June 2022, our focus has been on sourcing the finest, ethically-sourced beans from around the world. We are proud to partner with local and international farmers who share our commitment to quality and sustainability.</p>
            <p>But it's not just about the beans. At Four Beans Coffee we strive to create a space that goes beyond a typical coffee shop. It is a place where ideas are born, collaborations flourish, and connections are made. We have carefully designed our space to provide a comfortable and welcoming environment, whether you're looking to work, relax, or meet with a friend to catch up.</p>
            <p>We invite you to join us on this journey as we continue to pour our hearts into every cup we make.</p>
            <p>Come and sip on one of our specialty coffees today!</p>
